### __IMPLEMENTS: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, Web Forms, Events, SlideShow, Navbar, Responsive Web Design, UI__

This is the source code and accompanying media for my personal portfolio website which can be found [here](www.stevenpartlow.com). The site was coded from scratch using Visual Studio Code. The layout for the site is the standard layout which starts with a navbar, followed by a jumbotron style site header with scrolling text, then the site uses the two column, two row approach for the bio and github links in the top row with the skills and linkedIn sections below, followed by the footer then a button to bring up the contact form, which makes use of formspree to store any information entered by the user. The site is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices. The header also contains a simple slideshow made with JavaScript, I import the GT Walshiem Pro font from the the font awesome library so it can be used by CSS.
